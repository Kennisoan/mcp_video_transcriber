    - The video_url must be a full valid youtube video url that begins with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=
    - The tool will return the video object with it's status immediately. If the video is in the processing status, you can check back on it later by using get_video_transcripts tool with the same project_id (find the needed video in the response by it's id). The video will be transcribed in about a minute.
